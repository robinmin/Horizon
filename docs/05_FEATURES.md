# Features

> **Index page** over `docs/features/` satellites (99 §4.5). Both the satellites and this index's
> generated region are **tool-owned** (e.g. `spur feature`/`ftree`); edit through the tool, never
> with raw file writes. Edit order: satellite first, then refresh index (T9).

<!--
Never trust a row you have not verified — check status against code before citing or building on it.
One item per satellite; <feature-id> is the stable grep anchor. Renaming is a tool operation.
